# About Me

Hi! I’m **Chi Kit Ng (Justin)**, a PhD student at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)** in Electronic Engineering, supervised by [Prof. Hongliang Ren](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=rcF7N44AAAAJ&hl=en) in [IMMlab](http://www.labren.org/mm/).  
My research focuses on **end-to-end autonomous control of robotic endoscopes** and intelligent surgical robotics.  
I graduated from [CUHK EE](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/) with **First Class Honours**, ranking **1/54**.
